# Building a food ordering mysql database for a future react app (in progress)

# Purpose

I've recently been working on a react native app for food ordering, specifically halal food, an idea a friend of mine had. I've been working on
putting this app frontend and backend together as practice in refining my functional component skills. This walkthrough will cover bits of the basic
design of the mysql database and the setup in docker.
